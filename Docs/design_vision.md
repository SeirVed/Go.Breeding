# Design Vision

## Core statement
**Go.Breeding** is a single‑player, systems‑driven breeding sim. It prioritizes **emergent genetics**, readable evolution conditions, and a data‑driven content pipeline. The goal is a sandbox where **lineages tell stories** through traits and species unlocks, not scripted narrative.

## Pillars
1. **Readable depth** – Players should infer why outcomes happen.
2. **Deterministic outcomes** – Identical inputs yield identical results (seeded RNG).
3. **Orthogonal trait axes** – Each axis governs a different domain (morphology, development, ecology, heredity).
4. **Meaningful costs** – Rerolls/blends consume resources or lineage integrity.
5. **Parametric visuals** – Small art set, many perceived variants.

## Platforms
PC first. Console/Android possible later (same 2D assets).

## Tone & world
Semi‑fantastic demi‑species (cat/wolf/cow/elf/plant/dragon). Elements shape ecology. Labs and chrysalides provide “tech” framing for rerolls/lineage work.

## Loop (30s → 10m → 1h)
- **Acquire** stock → **Breed/Reroll** → **Evaluate** offspring → **Evolve/Unlock** → **Invest** in facilities → repeat.
- Long‑term: build stable dynasties or chase volatile mutation metas.

## Out of scope (v1)
- VN scene writing/romance systems.
- Real‑time action combat.
- Online multiplayer (import/export only).
