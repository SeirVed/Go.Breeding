# Invisible Traits

All values default to **0.0**; no negatives. Diminishing returns kick in after ~0.15–0.30.

## Categories & examples
### Breeding Efficiency
- `fertility_factor` (+0.00…+0.30)
- `gestation_efficiency` (+0.00…+0.25)
- `growth_acceleration` (+0.00…+0.20)
- `breeding_xp_bonus` (+0.00…+0.20)

### Transmission & Mutation
- `gene_lock` (raises heritability of selected traits)
- `mutation_flux` (increases chance of mutation events)
- `trait_rarity_bias` (higher odds for rare traits)

### Stat Potential
- `stat_ceiling_amp` (+cap per generation; not free stats)
- `inheritance_efficiency` (retains more parent stats)
- `training_responsiveness` (faster training gains)
- `specialization_bias` (skews toward chosen stat family)

### Health & Longevity
- `germline_integrity` (slows stability drift)
- `senescence_delay` (more breed cycles before sterility)
- `cross_compat_bias` (helps difficult crosses)

## Acquisition types
- **Baseline** (normal inheritance/mutation)
- **Species‑exclusive** (requires lateral transfer via crossbreeding)
- **Gated** (requires facility/story to express)
- **Environmental** (activated by breeding/gestation context)

Codex should label discovery type once known.
